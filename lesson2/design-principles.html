      <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>

      <p>I felt that the Home Depot did a good job of alignment. They have ther columns reduced so that you can
        find items under a given topic, like my image of maintenance essestials. This allows us to select the
        area we need without continuing to scroll.</p>

      <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org">The Church of Jesus Christ</a></h3>

      </picture>
      <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints home page is a great example of contrast. They make sure
        you can read everything clearly and with contrasting colors from images and text. When the image is dark the
        text is white and when words on a white background the text color is black.</p>

      <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>

          alt="apple watch ad page">
      </picture>
      <p>Apple is all about design and looking cool. Their main page uses different design elements, but I thought
        this part about apple watch was a good example of white space.</p>
