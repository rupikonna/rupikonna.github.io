                The Salt Lake Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) on
                Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. At 253,015 square feet (23,505.9 m2), it is the
                largest LDS temple by floor area. Dedicated in 1893, it is the sixth temple completed by the church,
                requiring 40 years to complete, and the fourth temple built since the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo,
                Illinois, in 1846. On April 19, 2019 the LDS Church announced that the temple would close on December
                29, 2019 for renovations that are anticipated to take approximately four years.<sup>1</sup>

                    The Washington D.C. Temple (formerly the Washington Temple) is the 18th constructed and 16th
                    operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It is located in
                    Kensington, Maryland, United States, just north of Washington, D.C., near the Capital Beltway. The
                    temple was dedicated in 1974 after an open house that attracted over 750,000 people, including
                    several international dignitaries. The temple was the first temple built by the church east of the
                    Mississippi River since 1846, when the original Nauvoo Temple was dedicated.</br>
                    </br>
                    Built at a cost of about $15 million in 1968, the temple is the church's tallest; its easternmost
                    spire is 288 feet (88 m) tall. Its floor area of 160,000 square feet (15,000 m2) is the
                    third-largest among church temples. Its design emulates the Salt Lake Temple with six spires, three
                    on each end, and the building is encased in white Alabama marble. It also has a visitors' center.
                    The architecture and highly visible location of the temple along the Capital Beltway has made the
                    temple a local landmark in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area.<sup>2</sup>

                    The London England Temple (formerly the London Temple) is the 12th operating temple of The Church of
                    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and is located in Newchapel, Surrey, England.</br>
                    </br>
                    The temple serves church members in south Wales, the Channel Islands, southern parts of England, the
                    Limerick District of Ireland, and Jordan.</br>
                    </br>
                    The site of the original 34,000 square foot building, located 25 miles south of London, was selected
                    in 1952 by David O. McKay and Stayner Richards. Building of the temple began on 27 August 1955,
                    and the temple was dedicated on 7 September 1958. Over 76,000 people toured the building during the
                    public open house before it was dedicated. It was the first LDS temple to be built in the United
                    Kingdom. Its construction was part of a growth in the number of temples, led by David O. McKay, who
                    performed the dedication.<sup>3</sup>

                    The Helsinki Finland Temple is the 124th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of
                    Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Unlike LDS chapels, where worship services are held and visitors are
                    welcome, the temple is open only to church members.</br>
                    </br>
                    Located at Lepp√§sillantie 3 in Espoo, the Helsinki Finland Temple has a total of 19,500 square feet
                    (1,810 m2), two ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms. It once served the geographically largest
                    temple district of the church, which included Finland, the Baltic states, and all of Russia. It
                    was the final temple dedicated during the presidency of Gordon B. Hinckley and the last dedicated by
                    Hinckley.<sup>4</sup>
